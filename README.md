# url-shortner
It is a simple URL-SHORTNER build for personal use using a short domain _fade.cf_
We just need to update the slug and trigger url in the JSON file and the Github Actions will automate the workflow.
like i have triggered the slug _ts_ to my personal website _tanishqsoni.me_
So when i go to the URL _fade.cf/ts_ it will directly jump to my personal website.
