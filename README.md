# URL-SHORTNER
It is a simple URL-SHORTNER build for personal use using a short domain **fade.cf**
We just need to update the slug and trigger url in the JSON file and the Github Actions will automate the workflow.
like i have triggered the slug **ts** to my personal website **tanishqsoni.me**
So when i go to the URL **fade.cf/ts** it will directly jump to my personal website.
